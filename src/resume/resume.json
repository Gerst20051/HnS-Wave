	"statement": "I'm seeking a Web Development position where I can join and collaboratively work with a team and/or independently to build quality web applications or games. I've been a Web Developer since 2005. I started because I wanted a central database accessible from anywhere on the internet of everything I owned. Mainly I wanted to document my games and have cheats for all of my games on my website I named Homenet. Homenet Spaces (HnS) was my first social network my spin on MySpace. I've always seen ways to improve the way we interact with our friends and family. I really want to use my skills to impact the world in life-changing ways. Another passion I have is listening to music so I've created multiple tools that offer different music listening experiences. Click for my book JavaScript Mastery.",
